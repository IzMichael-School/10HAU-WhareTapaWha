        <p>In 10HAU this term (Term 1) we discussed and learned about the 16 Personality Types. I decided that, based on
            what I know about myself, that I am an ISTJ, or a Logistician. 16personalities.com says: "A Logistician
            (ISTJ) is someone with the Introverted, Observant, Thinking, and Judging personality traits. These people
            tend to be reserved yet willful, with a rational outlook on life. They compose their actions carefully and
            carry them out with methodical purpose.". I would say that this statement describes me incredibly well. I've
            learned to embrace the aspects of myself that don't fit into the ISTJ type, as they are just as
            essential to a healthy life.</p>
