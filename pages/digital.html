        <p>In 10HAU this term (Term 1) we discussed many aspects of Digital Citizenship. That's the idea of being
            respectful and responsible while interacting with Digital Technologies. We learned about being responsible
            with the physical devices, screen time, and activity. We watched the documentary 'The Social Dilemma' which
            was about the way that social media has consumed many people's lives, and have isolated them from their
            friends, in the form of cyber-bullying, jealousy, and vanity. We learned about how ICT is gathering all
            sorts of data about us, which it can then use to advertise better.</p>
