        <p>In 10HAU this term (Term 1) we discussed the 'Whare Tapa Wha', or 'The House with Four Walls'. This concept
            refers to the four aspects of one's wellbeing. Said aspects are: 'Physical Wellbeing, Emotional Wellbeing,
            Social Wellbeing, and Spiritual Wellbeing'. Physical Wellbeing refers to your body's health, such as
            illness, injury, fitness, and the like. Emotional Wellbeing refers to your mental health, such as happiness,
            stress, anxiety, and more. Social Wellbeing is all about how you interact with others, such as friends,
            family, colleagues. Spiritual Wellbeing is about things like meditation, prayer, religion, etc.</p>
